IntelliMatch: AI Resume Screener

An AI-powered web app that matches candidate resumes with job descriptions using Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF) and Machine Learning.

---

Overview

IntelliMatch is a smart AI-based Resume Screening System built using Streamlit and Scikit-learn.  
It helps recruiters automatically evaluate and rank resumes based on TF-IDF similarity with a given Job Description,  
and provides an AI-powered Hire/Reject prediction.
